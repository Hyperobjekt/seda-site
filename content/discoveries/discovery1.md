White-Black school segregation is one of the strongest predictors of White-Black achievement gaps. This relation persists even after accounting for many other factors. In this figure, we compare the average change in segregation to the average change in the White-Black gap over the 2009-18 school years. Because of the large number of school districts in our data, each circle represents a group of districts with that rate of change in segregation. The graph shows the average trend in the gap for these districts after controlling for dozens of other district-level attributes. 

Here, we define school segregation as the difference in school poverty rates for White and Black students in a district. Where segregation increases, Black students attend schools with increasingly higher poverty rates than White students. As this figure shows, White-Black achievement gaps grow fastest where school segregation increases fastest. This indicates that trends in school segregation are closely related to trends in academic inequality.
