<span class="drop-cap">I</span>nequalities in academic scores move with socioeconomic inequality, so when socioeconomic inequality is higher, academic achievement gaps also tend to grow. For example, consider socioeconomic inequality for Black and white families within the same school district. In nearly all U.S. communities, white families are more affluent than Black families. In some places, these socioeconomic inequalities are growing (e.g., in Houston), while in others they are shrinking (e.g., in Gwinnett).

Among the 40 school districts with the highest student enrollment, there is a lot of variation in socioeconomic inequality. We measure socioeconomic inequality as the average difference in socioeconomic status (SES) between the white residents and the Black residents within a school district. In Hawaii, white residents' average SES is less than 0.5 SDs higher than Black residents' SES. In Chicago, white residents' average SES is over 4 SDs higher than Black residents' SES.

This difference, which reflects differences in access to local resources and experiences between white and Black residents, predicts changes in childrenâ€™s academic achievement disparities over time. In Houston, the academic achievement gap has increased by more than a grade-level, or 36.8%, in one decade. At this rate, the 2009 White-Black achievement gap in Houston, where socioeconomic inequality is high, will double by the year 2036. In Hawaii, on the other hand, where socioeconomic inequality is relatively low, the academic achievement gap has decreased by over one-third of a grade-level, or 23.1%. At this rate, the gap in Hawaii would close by 2052.
