<span class="drop-cap">I</span>n nearly all U.S. communities, white families are more affluent than Black families. In some places, these socioeconomic inequalities are growing (e.g., in Houston), while in others they are shrinking (e.g., in Gwinnett). Inequalities in academic scores move with socioeconomic inequality, so when socioeconomic inequality grows, academic achievement gaps also tend to grow.

Among the 20 largest school districts, shown above, there is a lot of variation in how much socioeconomic inequality is changing. We measure socioeconomic inequality as the average difference in socioeconomic status (SES) between the census tracts where white residents live and the census tracts where Black residents live within that school district. In Gwinnett County, socioeconomic inequality has dropped by 0.36 SDs. In Houston, residential socioeconomic inequality has increased by 0.63 SDs.

This difference, which reflects changes in the differences in access to resources and neighborhood experiences between white and Black residents, predicts changes in childrenâ€™s academic achievement disparities over time. In Houston, the academic achievement gap has increased by more than a grade-level, or 31.5%, in one decade. At this rate, the 2009 White-Black achievement gap in Houston will double by the year 2041. In Hawaii, on the other hand, where socioeconomic inequality has decreased over the past decade by a small amount (0.01 SDs), the academic achievement gap has decreased by over one-third of a grade-level, or 25.8%. At this rate, the gap in Hawaii would close by 2048.

Changes in socioeconomic inequality do not perfectly predict changes in academic achievement disparities. There is still a lot of variation in local policy and practice that is not accounted for by measures of socioeconomic inequality. Still, this relationship is one of the most robust among dozens of factors we explored. Further, in places where inequality is growing, gaps are widening much faster than they are closing in places where inequality is decreasing. This century, more places will double their gaps than will close them. The pandemic--and the vast inequalities in well-being and educational opportunities being documented as it plays out--will likely exacerbate these disparities even further.
