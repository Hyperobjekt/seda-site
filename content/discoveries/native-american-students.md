<span class="drop-cap">D</span>ata from 462 counties show that Native American students’ performance on state assessments at the end of 3rd grade varies widely across the U.S. In 103 of these counties, Native American students perform close to or above the national average (dots near and to the right of the y-axis), suggesting that they are receiving many opportunities to learn from birth through 3rd grade. However, these 103 counties serve relatively few Native American students (shown by the small size of the gray and green dots on the graph) and collectively serve only a small fraction of Native American students in the U.S. The majority of the U.S. Native American student population, living in the other 359 counties, have average 3rd grade test scores significantly below the national average (shown in light and dark blue on the graph). In other words, most Native American students are living in counties where, on average, they enter school having received fewer educational opportunities than the typical U.S. student.

Native American students’ opportunities to learn during school, on the other hand, tell a more promising story. In many of the counties where Native American students are scoring below-average in 3rd grade, they are learning at higher-than-average rates from 3rd to 8th grade (these counties are highlighted in light blue on the graph). In Navajo County, Arizona, for example, students are scoring almost 3 grade levels below the national average in 3rd grade, but they are learning 14% more each year than the average U.S. student. Put another way, over the 5 years from 3rd to 8th grade, these students learn 5.7 grade levels of material or .7 grade levels more than the average student. This signals that, while these students may have had limited access to early educational opportunities, they are receiving substantial opportunities to learn in their late elementary and middle school years. It is important to note, however, that this is not the case everywhere and there are many counties in which Native American students are learning at lower-than-average rates (these counties are shown in dark blue and gray on the graph). 

Paired with the appropriate historical, economic, and social context, this data can help us determine how and where social and education systems can be improved to better serve Native American students and their families. For example, the data explorer shows that Native American family socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with Native American students’ average test scores, and in the counties with the lowest average test scores, the average Native American family is much poorer than the average U.S. family. Therefore, factors such as poverty may significantly limit access to certain early educational opportunities, as well as other health and social resources linked to early academic achievement. More research is needed to understand the many factors that shape Native American students’ educational opportunities and how to best support Native American students in our schools and beyond.
