The Stanford Education Data Archive contains average test score estimates and learning rates for Native American students living in 462 counties across the U.S. These data show that, at the end of 3rd grade, Native American student performance on assessment tests varies widely by county. In 103 (22%) of U.S. counties, Native American students perform at or above the national average. These higher-performing counties typically serve small numbers of Native American students (small bubble sizes). In the other 78% of the counties that serve the bulk of the U.S. Native American student population, the average test scores of Native American 3rd graders fall below, and in some cases very far below, the national average. These low average test scores signal that Native American students across the U.S. are likely entering school having received fewer educational opportunities than the average U.S. student.

Native American students’ opportunities to learn during school, on the other hand, tell a more promising story. In many of the counties where Native American students have had relatively fewer opportunities to learn by 3rd grade, they are learning at a higher than average rate during school years (upper left quadrant). For example, in Navajo County, Arizona, students are scoring almost 3 grade levels below the national average in 3rd grade, but they are learning 14% more each year than the average U.S. student. Put another way, over the five years from 3rd to 8th grade, these students learn 5.7 grade levels of material (.7 grade levels more than the average student). This signals that these students are receiving substantial opportunities to learn in their elementary and middle school years. But it is important to note that this is not the case everywhere and there is large variability in Native American students’ average learning rates among counties. For example, in Robeson County, North Carolina, Native American students are performing less than one grade level behind the national average in 3rd grade. However, they learn about 20% less each year than the average student (only gaining 4 grade levels over the 5 years from 3rd to 8th grade).

Paired with the appropriate historical, economic, and social context, this information can help us determine how and where social and education systems can be improved to better serve Native American students and their families. For instance, among counties, Native American socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with average test scores and in many counties Native American families are, on average, poorer than the average U.S. family [link to explorer view]. In these areas, poverty may limit families’ access to certain early educational opportunities, as well as other health and social resources linked to achievement [link to report]. Overall, many factors contribute to the types of educational opportunities students have available to them, and more research is needed to understand how to best support Native American students in our schools and beyond.
