Yes. Public charter schools serving students in grades 3¬–8 are included in the data. Any public school serving grade 3–8 students—whether a traditional public school or a charter school—is included, as long as there is a sufficient number of students to provide precise information. In the district data, charter schools are considered to part of the geographic district chartering them. Charter schools not chartered by a district are considered to be part of the district in which they are physically located. A crosswalk indicating which schools are charter schools and what districts they are associated with in the data is available from the <a href="/get-the-data">data download page</a>.
