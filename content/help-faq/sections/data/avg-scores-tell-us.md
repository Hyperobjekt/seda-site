To understand the role of educational opportunities in shaping average test-score patterns, it is necessary to distinguish between <i>individual scores</i> and <i>average scores</i> in a given school, district, or county.  

Differences in two studentsâ€™ <i>individual test scores</i> at a given age reflect both differences in their individual characteristics and abilities and differences in the educational opportunities they have had. However, because the <i>average</i> innate abilities of students born in one community do not differ from those born in another place, any difference in <i>average test scores</i> must reflect differences in the educational opportunities available in the two communities.
