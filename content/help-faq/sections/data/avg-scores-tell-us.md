To understand the role of educational opportunities in shaping average test score patterns, it is necessary to distinguish between individual scores and average scores in a given school, district, or county.  

A student’s test score at a given age reflects both her innate cognitive ability and the educational opportunities she has had from birth until the time she took the test. So two students’ scores may differ because of individual ability and/or their history of educational opportunity.

Likewise, the average test scores of students in a given school or community reflect both their average individual abilities and average educational opportunities. But importantly, the average individual abilities of students born in one community do not differ from those born in another place. Therefore, any difference in average test scores between two communities must reflect differences in average educational opportunities, not differences in average ability.

A child’s educational opportunities include all experiences that contribute to her learning the skills assessed on standardized tests. These include opportunities both in early childhood and during the schooling years, and include experiences in their homes, in their neighborhoods, in their childcare and preschool programs, with their peers, and in their schools. Thus, the average test scores of students in a specific grade reflect the average set of educational opportunities a community (including its families, organizations, and schools) has provided to children prior to that grade.
