To understand the role of educational opportunities in shaping average test score patterns, it is necessary to distinguish between individual scores and average scores in a given school, district, or county.  

A studentâ€™s test score at a given age reflects her innate cognitive ability as well as the educational opportunities she has had. The differences in individual scores may be explained by differences in both innate ability and the educational opportunities they have had. However, because the average innate abilities of students born in one community do not differ from those born in another place, any difference in average test scores must reflect differences in the educational opportunities available in the two communities.
