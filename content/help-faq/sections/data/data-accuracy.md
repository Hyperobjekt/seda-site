The data in SEDA use a variety of statistical and psychometric methods to measure average test scores, learning, and trends. Validation done by the SEDA research team shows that these methods recover unbiased school and district average test scores within each state <span class="highlight">[link to HETOP]</span> and enable comparisons of scores across states <span class="highlight">[link to linking paper]</span>. In addition, each score in SEDA has an associated “standard error” indicating how precise the estimate is. See the FAQ question, "Why do SEDA results disagree with results from my state test?" below, the <a href="/methods">Methods</a> section of the website, and the <span class="highlight">documentation</span> for more details.
