We have taken a number of steps to ensure the accuracy of the data reported here. The statistical and psychometric methods underlying the data we report are published in peer-reviewed journals and described on the <a href="/methods">Methods page</a> and in the <a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:db586ns4974/seda_documentation_4.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical documentation</a>.

Along with each estimate, we also report a margin of error equal to a 95% confidence interval. For example, a margin of error of +/- .1 indicates that we have 95% confidence that the true value is within +/- .1 of the estimated value. Large margins of error signal that we are not confident in the estimate reported on the site.

Nonetheless, there may still be errors in the data files that we have not yet identified. If you believe you have found an error in the data, we would appreciate knowing about it.
