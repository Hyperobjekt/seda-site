We have taken a number of steps to ensure the accuracy of the data reported here. The statistical and psychometric methods underlying the data we report are published in peer-reviewed journals and described on the <a href="/methods">Methods page</a> and in the <a href="/papers/SEDA_documentation_v30_DRAFT09212019.pdf" target="_blank">technical documentation</a>. Nonetheless, there may still be errors in the data files that we have not yet identified. If you believe you have found an error in the data, we would appreciate knowing about it. Please contact our SEDA support team at <a href="mailto:sedasupport@stanford.edu" target="_blank">sedasupport@stanford.edu</a>.
