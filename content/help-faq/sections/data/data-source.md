The data are based on the standardized accountability tests in math and English Language Arts (ELA) administered annually by each state to all public-school students in grades 3–8 from 2008–09 through 2015–16. In these years, third- through eighth-graders in U.S. public schools took roughly 350 million standardized math and ELA tests. Their scores—provided to us in aggregated form by the U.S. Department of Education—are the basis of the data reported here.

We combine information on the test scores in each school, school district, or county with information from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP; see <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/" target="_blank" title="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/">https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/</a>) to compare scores from state tests on a common national scale (see <a href="/methods">Methods</a>).

We never see nor use individual student test scores in this process. The raw data we receive includes only counts of students scoring at different test score levels, not individual test scores. There is no individual or individually-identifiable information included in the raw or public data.
