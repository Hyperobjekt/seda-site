The gap in percent minority students in schools is a measure of school segregation. Percent minority students in schools is measured as the proportion of minority students (black students plus Hispanic students) in a student’s school. The black-white gap in percent minority students in schools then measures the difference between the proportion of minority students in the average black student’s school and the proportion of minority students in the average white student’s school. When there is no segregation—when white and black students attend the same schools, or when white and black students’ schools have equal proportions of minority students—the black-white gap in percent minority students is 0. A positive black-white gap in percent minority students means that black students’ schools have higher shares of minority students than white students’ schools, on average. A negative black-white gap in percent minority students means that white students’ schools have higher shares of minority students than black students’ schools, on average.
