The gap in school poverty (shown in the secondary gap charts) is a measure of school segregation. We use the proportion of students defined as “economically disadvantaged” in a school as a measure of school poverty. The black-white gap in school poverty, for example, measures the difference between the poverty rate of the average black student’s school and the poverty rate of the average white student’s school. When there is no segregation—when white and black students attend the same schools, or when white and black students’ schools have equal poverty rates—the black-white school poverty gap is 0. A positive black-white school poverty gap means that black students’ schools have higher poverty rates than white students’ schools, on average. A negative black-white school poverty gap means that white students’ schools have higher poverty rates than black students’ schools, on average.
