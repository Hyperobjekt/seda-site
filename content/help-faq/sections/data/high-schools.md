The data currently includes only schools and districts that enroll students in grades 3–8. High schools serving only grades 9–12 are not included. But schools that enroll both high school students and students in some of grades 3–8 are included. For these schools, the reported test score measures are based only on the scores of students in grades 3–8. For example, schools serving grades 7–12 are included in the data, but the test scores we use are only those from grades 7–8 students.
