Once the test scores are placed on a common scale across states, grades, and years, we have measures of the average test scores in up to 96 grade-year-subject cells for each school, district, or county. The scores are adjusted so that a value of 3 corresponds to the average achievement of 3rd graders nationally, a value of 4 corresponds to the average achievement of 4th graders nationally, and so on. 
Average test score. To compute the average test score, we compare students in each grade, year, and subject with the national average and then combine them. 

Learning rate. To compute the average learning rate, we compare students’ average scores in one grade and year to those in the next grade and year. For example, we compare the average math score in grade 3 in 2009 to the average math score in grade 4 in 2010. The difference is an estimate of the learning rate in a specific grade and subject for a specific cohort of students. We then compute the same change for each cohort, grade, and subject for which we have data. The average of these grade-to-grade changes (across cohorts, grades, and subjects) is the learning rate. A learning rate of 1.0 indicates that average student’s scores improve by one grade level each grade. 

Trend in test scores: To compute trends in test scores, we compare students’ average scores in one grade and year to those in the same grade in the next year. For example, we compare the average math score in grade 3 in 2009 to the average math score in grade 3 in 2010. The difference between these two values indicates how much math scores improved in one year in grade 3. We then compute the same change for each year, grade, and subject. The average of these annual changes (across years, grades, and subjects) is the trend in test scores.
