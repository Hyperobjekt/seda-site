If a school or district is flagged (see image below) as missing more than 50% of test score data for recent years (2016-2018), this means that estimates are based on older data (before 2016). Why? Less data were reported between 2016-2018 due to state test opt out which began in the Spring of 2015. Reasons for opt out vary and the number of parents opting students out of taking state assessments also vary year-to-year. To learn more about opt out policies for students in your area, we recommend that you visit your local school, district, or state website.
