There are several reasons that SEDA may not contain data for a school, district, or county: 

- The school or district is too small and/or has too few grades to allow for an accurate estimate.
- Fewer than 95% of students in the school or district participated in testing in the subject, grade, and year. 
- More than 40% of students in the school, district, or county took alternative assessments rather than the regular tests.
- Data were not reported to the National Center for Education Statistics.
- Students took different, incomparable tests within the same subject, grade, and year. This is something our methodology cannot adjust for.
- We identified data errors that would result in inaccurate estimates.
