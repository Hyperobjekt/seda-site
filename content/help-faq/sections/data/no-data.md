There are several reasons a school or district may not have a SEDA score: 

- The school or district is too small to allow for a precise estimate.
- Less than 95% of students in the school or district participated in testing in the subject, grade, and year. 
- Data were not reported to the National Center for Education Statistics.
- Students took different and incomparable tests within the subject, grade, and year.
- We identified clear data errors that would result in inaccurate estimates.
