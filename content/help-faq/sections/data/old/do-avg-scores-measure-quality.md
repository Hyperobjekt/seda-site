No. It is inappropriate to attribute the average test scores to school quality alone. Many factors—both early in life and when children are in school—affect test performance. As a result, the average test scores in a school, district, or county reflect the total set of educational opportunities children have had from birth through middle school, including opportunities at home, in child care and preschool programs, and among peers. Average test scores therefore reflect a mix of school quality and out-of-school educational opportunities.
