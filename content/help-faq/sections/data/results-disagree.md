SEDA results may differ from publicly reported state test scores. 

States typically report test scores in terms of “percentages of proficient students.” They may also report data only for a single year and grade, or collapse percentages of proficient students across years and grades. 

In contrast, the SEDA data takes into account more information, using data from all proficiency thresholds (e.g., “basic”, “proficient”, “advanced”). It also accounts for arbitrary changes in proficiency standards across states, years, and grades. 

SEDA may also differ slightly from other publicly available measures of school and district performance due to research methods. We provide a comparison of SEDA and other measures in our research papers, here. 

In other cases, states may report average test scores using a state-specific score scale. But these state-specific values cannot be compared across states, and in some cases cannot be compared across grades within the same state. The SEDA measures have been adjusted to account for differences in tests across states and grades.
