For each school district or county, we use data from the Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs" target="_blank">American Community Survey</a> (ACS) to create estimates of the average socioeconomic status (SES) of families. Every year, the ACS surveys families in each community in the U.S. We use six community characteristics reported in 5-year rolling surveys from 2005-2009 through 2014-2018 to construct a composite measure of SES in each community:

- Median income
- Percentage of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher
- Poverty rate among households with children age 5–17
- Percentage of households receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
- Percentage of households headed by single mothers
- Employment rate for adults age 25–64.

The composite SES measure is standardized so that a value of 0 represents the SES of the average school district in the U.S. Approximately two-thirds of districts have SES values between -1 and +1, and approximately 95% have SES values between -2 and +2 (so values larger than 2 or smaller than -2 represent communities with very high or very low average socioeconomic status, respectively). In some places we cannot calculate a reliable measure of socioeconomic status, because the ACS samples are too small; in these cases, no value for SES is reported.
