For each school district or county, we use data from the [American Community Survey] (ACS) to create estimates of the average socioeconomic status (SES) of families. Every year, the ACS examines families in each community in the U.S. We use six community characteristics reported in the surveys from 2007 through 2016:

- Median income
- Percentage of adults ages 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher
- Poverty rate among households with children ages 5–17
- Percentage of households receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
- Percentage of households headed by single mothers
- Employment rate for adults ages 25–64.

We compute a composite SES measure based on these characteristics. The measure is standardized so that a value of 0 represents the SES of the average school district in the U.S. Approximately two-thirds of districts have SES values between -1 and +1, and approximately 95% have SES values between -2 and +2.
