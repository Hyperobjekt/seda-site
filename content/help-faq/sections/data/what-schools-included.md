All public schools—traditional, charter, and magnet schools—that serve students in any grade from 3 through 8 are included in the data.

The data include public schools that enroll students in grades 3–8. Schools that enroll both high school students and students in some of grades 3–8 are included, but the reported test-score measures are based only on the scores of students in grades 3–8. For example, schools serving grades 7–12 are included in the data, but the test scores we use are only those from students in grades 7–8.

In the district data, charter schools are considered to be part of the district or county in which they are physically located. A data file indicating which schools are charter schools and what districts and counties they are associated with in the data is available from the <a href="/get-the-data">Get the Data page</a>.

Estimates for special education schools are included in the school-level data files; however, special education schools are not included in the district or county estimates. 

We do not use or report test scores from virtual schools.

In most states, students in private schools do not take the annual state accountability tests that we use to build SEDA. Therefore, no test scores from private schools are included in the raw or public data.
