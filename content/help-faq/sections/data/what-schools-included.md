All public schools—both traditional and charter schools—that serve students in any grade from 3 through 8 are included in the data. 

The data include public schools that enroll students in grades 3–8. Schools that enroll both high school students and students in some of grades 3–8 are included, but the reported test score measures are based only on the scores of students in grades 3–8. For example, schools serving grades 7–12 are included in the data, but the test scores we use are only those from grades 7–8 students.

In the district data, charter schools are considered part of the traditional public school district chartering them. Charter schools not chartered by a district are considered to be part of the district in which they are physically located. A data file indicating which schools are charter schools and what districts they are associated with in the data is available from the [data download page]. 

We do not use or report test score information from virtual schools.

In most states, students in private schools do not take annual state accountability tests that we use to build SEDA. Therefore, no test scores from private schools are included in the raw or the public data.
