<span class="highlight">[then you want to tell us that you can learn different things by looking at the data in different ways. And then take us through the three. You want this answer to be framed by “what we can learn” more than “how is calculated”]</span> 

The data include three measures for each school, district, and county in the U.S.: average test scores, learning rates, and trends in test scores. The estimates shown on the website are based on an average of math and ELA scores, though separate math and ELA estimates are available from the [data download page]. Each of the three measures is described below.

Average test scores: the average test score—averaged over grades 3–8 and school years 2008–09 to 2015–16—in a school, district, or county. The average test score reflects the total set of educational opportunities available to children from birth through middle school, including both school-based and out-of-school educational opportunities.
 
Learning rate: the average per-grade change in test scores from grade 3 to 8, within a cohort of students. The learning rate reflects the educational opportunities students experience in grades 3–8. Because most educational opportunities in these years are provided by schools, the average learning rate largely reflects school quality.
 
Trend in test scores: the average annual change of test scores from one year to the next, within a grade. The trend in scores indicates how rapidly average test scores within a school/district/county have changed over time. The trend in average scores reflects changes across student cohorts in the total set of educational opportunities available to children.
