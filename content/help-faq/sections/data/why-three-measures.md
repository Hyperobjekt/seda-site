We summarize the test score data in three different ways in order to highlight different aspects of educational opportunities. For each school, district, and county in the U.S., we report: average test scores, learning rates, and trends in test scores. 

+ Average test score: The average test score indicates how well the average student in a school, district, or county performs on standardized tests. Importantly, many factors—both early in life and when children are in school—affect test performance. As a result, the average test scores in a school, district, or county reflect the total set of educational opportunities children have had from birth through middle school, including opportunities at home, in child care and preschool programs, and among peers. Average test scores therefore reflect a mix of school quality and out-of-school educational opportunities. 
 
+ Learning rate: The learning rate indicates approximately how much students learn in each grade in a school, district, or county. Because most educational opportunities students experience in grades 3–8 are provided by schools, the average learning rate largely reflects school quality. 
 
+ Trend in test scores: The trend in scores indicates how rapidly average test scores within a school, district, or county have changed over time. It reflects changes over time in the total set of educational opportunities (in and out of schools) available to children. For example, average scores might improve over time because the schools are improving and/or because more high-income families have moved into the community.

For more information on how the average, learning rate, and trend in test scores are computed, see the [methods overview].
