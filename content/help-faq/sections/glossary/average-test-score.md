The average test score indicates how well the average student in a school, district, or county performs on standardized tests. Importantly, many factors—both early in life and when children are in school—affect test performance. As a result, the average test scores in a school, district, or county reflect the total set of educational opportunities children have had from birth through middle school, including opportunities at home, in child-care and preschool programs, and among peers. Average test scores therefore reflect a mix of school quality and out-of-school educational opportunities.
