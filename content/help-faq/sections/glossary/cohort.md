A group of students beginning school together in the same year. For example, the 2006 cohort refers to students who were first enrolled in kindergarten in the fall of 2005 (and finished in the spring of 2006). While some of these students may repeat or skip a grade during school, the majority will progress through school together in the same grades each year.
