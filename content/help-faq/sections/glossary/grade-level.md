As described in the <a href="/methods">Methods</a> section, the test-score data in SEDA are adjusted so that a “4” represents the average test scores of 4th graders nationally, a “5” represents the average test scores of 5th graders nationally, and so on. One “grade level” thus corresponds to the average per-grade increase in test scores for students nationally.
