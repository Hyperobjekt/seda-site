Most public-school districts in the U.S. are defined by a geographic catchment area; the schools that fall within this boundary make up the geographically defined school district. The physical boundaries of geographic catchment areas have changed over time; we use the 2019 EDGE Elementary and Unified School District Boundaries to define geographic districts included in SEDA. Note that geographically defined school districts exclude special education schools (as identified by the Common Core of Data’s school type flag), regardless of the school’s physical location.
