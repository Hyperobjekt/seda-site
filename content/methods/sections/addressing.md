### SEDA methods: Addressing the challenges

While these challenges are substantial, they are not insurmountable. The EOP team has developed methods to address these challenges in order to produce estimates of students’ average test scores, average learning rates across grades, and trends over time in each school, district, and county in the U.S. All of these estimates are comparable across states, grades, and years. 

Below we describe the raw data used to create SEDA and how we:

1. <a href="#" data-scroll-target="prof-threshold" class="scroll-to-section">Estimate the location of each state’s proficiency “thresholds”</a>
2. <a href="#" data-scroll-target="placing-proficiency" class="scroll-to-section">Place the proficiency thresholds on the same scale</a>
3. <a href="#" data-scroll-target="estimating-means" class="scroll-to-section">Estimate the mean test scores in each school, district, county, commuting zone, metropolitan statistical area, and state from the raw data and the threshold estimates</a>
4. <a href="#" data-scroll-target="scaling-estimates" class="scroll-to-section">Scale the estimates so they are measured in terms of grade levels</a>
5. <a href="#" data-scroll-target="reducing" class="scroll-to-section">Create estimates of average scores, learning rates, and trends in average scores.</a>
6. <a href="#" data-scroll-target="reporting" class="scroll-to-section">Report the data</a>
7. <a href="#" data-scroll-target="data-accuracy" class="scroll-to-section">Ensure Data Accuracy</a>
