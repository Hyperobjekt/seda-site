### SEDA Methods: Addressing the Challenges

The SEDA research team has addressed these challenges in order to produce estimates of students’ average performance, average growth across grades, and the trend over time that are comparable across places, grades, and years. 

Below we describe the raw data used to create SEDA and how we:

1. Recover proficiency “thresholds”
2. Place the proficiency thresholds on the same scale
3. Estimate the mean test score from the coarsened data and the threshold estimates
4. Scale the estimates to grade-equivalents
5. Create estimates of mean performance, growth and trend.
6. Report the data
