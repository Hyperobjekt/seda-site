<h3>Background</h3>

Federal law requires all states to test all students in grades 3-8 each year in math and RLA (commonly called “accountability” testing). It also requires that states make the aggregated results of those tests public. 

All states report test results for schools and school districts to the Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which houses this data in the EDFacts database. There are two versions of this data: a public version, available on their website, and a restricted version, available by request. For security, the public data are censored. That is, data for small places or small subgroups are not reported to ensure the privacy of the students. In contrast, the restricted files contain all data, regardless of the number of students within the school/district or subgroup. We use the restricted files to estimate test score distributions in schools, school districts, counties, commuting zones, metropolitan statistical areas, and states. Details on this process can be found below.
