<h3>Background</h3>

Federal law requires all states to test all students in grades 3-8 each year in math and ELA (commonly called “accountability” testing). It also requires that states make the aggregated results of those tests publicly available. 

All states report the test results for schools and school districts to the Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which houses this data in the EDFacts database. There are two versions of this data: a public version, available on their website, and a restricted version, available by request. For security, the public data is censored. Data for small places or small subgroups is not reported to ensure the privacy of the students. In contrast, the restricted data contains all data, regardless of number of students within the school/district or subgroup.
