In this example, State B looks more “proficient” than State A because 300 of their students score proficient compared to 100 students in State A. But, their achievement was identical! The bottom line: If you only use the proficiency data without accounting for where they thresholds for proficiency are places, you could end up with the wrong conclusion about which state performed better.

This problem is actually even more complicated that the example suggests because states use different tests with material of varying difficulty and scores reported on different scales. So, it is not even clear that we could compare their proficiency thresholds.

Even within a state, different tests are used in different grade levels. This means that, for example, we cannot compare the performance of students in 4th grade in one year to that of students in 5th grade in the next year. In other words, we cannot measure average growth.

States change the grade-level tests they use over time. This may result from changes in curricular standards; for example, the introduction of the Common Core State Standards led to many states adopting different tests. These test changes make it hard to compare average performance in one year to the next. In other words, we cannot recover reliable estimates of trends over time.
