<h3>Estimating the mean from proficiency count data</h3>

The next step of our process is to estimate the mean test score in each school, district, county, commuting zone, metropolitan statistical area, and state for all students and by student subgroups (gender, race/ethnicity, and economic disadvantage). To do this, we estimate heteroskedastic ordered probit models using both the raw proficiency count data (shown above) and the linked thresholds from the prior step. This method allows us to estimate the mean standardized test score in a school or district for every subgroup, subject, grade, and year on the same scale.
