*There is a small amount of missing data. For example, during years in which a state was piloting a new test, it may not have reported any data or may not have reported data for all schools to EDFacts. In addition, there are some cases where all students in the state do not take the same test in a given grade-year-subject, as well as some cases where the participation rate in state is too low to allow us to reliable perform estimation (e.g., due to opt out or pilot testing). We do not use or provide data for these states, subjects, grades, and years. For more details, please see TABLE X in the Technical Documentation.
