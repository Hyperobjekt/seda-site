### Raw Data

The data used to develop SEDA comes from the EDFacts Restricted-Use Files, provided to our team via a data use agreement with NCES.

ED<i>Facts</i> provides counts of students scoring in proficiency levels for nearly every school in the U.S. For details on missing data, see the SEDA Technical Documentation.

Data are available for:

- School Years 2008-09 through 2015-16
- Grades 3-8
- Math and English Language Arts (ELA)
- Various subgroups of students: all students, racial/ethnic subgroups, gender subgroups, economic subgroups, etc.

The data also contain NCES identifiers, which allow the data to be linked to other databases or combined into different aggregations (e.g., school districts, counties, etc.).

Below is a mock-up of the data format:
