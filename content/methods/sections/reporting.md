<h3>Reporting the data</h3>
<h5>Suppression of Estimates </h5>

We do not report average performance, learning, and/or trend estimates if:

- FFewer than 95% of students in the school, district, county, metropolitan statistical area, commuting zone, or state were tested. 
- More than 40% of students in the school, district, county, metropolitan statistical area, or commuting zone took alternative assessments.
- Fewer than 20 students are represented in the estimate.
- The estimates are too imprecise to be informative.
