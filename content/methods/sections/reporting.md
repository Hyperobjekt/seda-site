<h3>Reporting the data</h3>
<h5>Suppression of Estimates </h5>

We do not report average performance, learning, and/or trend estimates if:

- Fewer than 95% of students in the school, district or county were tested.
- More than 40% of students in the school, district, county, commuting zone, or metropolitan statistical area took alternative assessments.
- Fewer than 20% of students are represented in the estimate.
