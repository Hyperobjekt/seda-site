<h3>Scaling the Estimates to Grade Equivalents</h3>

On the website, we report all data in grade equivalent units, or what we call the Grade within Cohort Standardized (GCS) scale. On this scale, users can interpret 1-unit as 1-grade level. The national average performance, for comparison, is 3 in grade 3, 4 in grade 4, and so on. 
To convert our estimates from the NAEP scale into grade equivalents, we have to first approximate the average amount students’ test scores grow in a grade on NAEP. To do this, we use data from three national NAEP cohorts: the cohorts who were in 4th grade in 2009, 2011, and 2013. Below we show the average national NAEP scores (Expanded Population Estimates) in grades 4 and 8 for these three cohorts. We average over the three cohorts to create a stable baseline (reference group) that uses as much information as possible.

We calculate the amount the test scores changed between 4th and 8th grade (Average 4th to 8th Grade Growth) as the average score in 8th grade minus the average score in 4th grade. Then, to get an estimate of per-grade growth, we divide that value by 4 (Average Per Grade Growth).

|         	| Average 4th Grade Score 	| Average 8th Grade Score 	| Average 4th to 8th Grade Growth 	| Average Per-Grade Growth 	|
|---------	|-------------------------	|-------------------------	|---------------------------------	|--------------------------	|
| Math    	| 239.2                   	| 281.3                   	| 42.1                            	| 10.52                    	|
| Reading 	| 218                     	| 263.9                   	| 46                              	| 11.49                    	|

Now, we can use these numbers to rescale the SEDA estimates that are on the NAEP scale into grade equivalents. From the SEDA estimates we subtract the 4th grade average score, divide by the per-grade growth, and add 4. 

<h5>Example</h5>

A score of 250 in 4th grade math becomes:
	(250 – 239.2)/10.52 + 4 = 5.02.

In other words, these students score at a 5th grade level or approximately 1 grade level ahead of the national average for their grade.

A score of 200 in 3rd grade reading becomes:
	(200 – 218.0)/11.49 + 4 = 2.44.

In other words, these students score approximately half a grade level behind the national average for third graders.
