The Chicago Public Schools are more successful than they are given credit for. In 3rd grade, where our test data begins, students in Chicago test below a 2nd-grade level, as shown in the accompanying chart. 

This chart highlights the relationship between how rich a district is and how its students perform on standardized tests in 3rd grade. The horizontal axis shows the average family socioeconomic status (SES) in the district [link to FAQ for explanation], where 0 represents the SES of the average district in the U.S. More affluent districts are located to the right in the figure; poorer districts to the left. 

In many ways the pattern shown here is not surprising: children’s scores are much higher in richer districts. In relatively affluent Anne Arundel County, MD, the average test scores are well above average in 3rd grade. In Chicago, by contrast, average test scores are far below average.<br><br>

<br><br>... and by 8th grade Chicago students achieve near the national average, meaning that they experience the equivalent of six years of average learning in the five years between 3rd and 8th grade. The families in Chicago’s public schools tend to be lower in socioeconomic status, and the average test scores are relatively modest, but, year after year, the schools are lifting children up at an impressive rate.   

In Anne Arundel, the opposite is true. Although students there are more affluent than average and score above a 4th grade level in 3rd grade, they learn at a far lower rate than their Chicago peers. By 8th grade their scores are only slightly above average. 

It’s common to think of the average test scores in a school as a rough measure of school quality. After all, if students are scoring well on tests, they must be learning something, right? To understand what is wrong with this assumption, though, consider a hospital. We wouldn’t assess a hospital based on the health of its patients; rather, we’d judge it on how much its patients’ health improves as a result of their time in the hospital. Similarly, we shouldn’t evaluate a school based on the average scores of its students, but rather by how much they the students learn while in school. If we can measure the change in test scores as students move from one grade to the next, we gain a more accurate picture of what a school is accomplishing.<br><br>

<br><br>The Opportunity Explorer provides this data — the “learning rate” — for schools, school districts, and counties across the country. The result is an unexpected story of the quality of public education in the United States. We see, for example, that students in some relatively affluent districts—like Anne Arundel County—show little learning as they progress from one grade to the next. We discover, too, that students in some poor districts start off testing far below average but the schools seem appear to be doing an outstanding job, and the students eventually catch up to the national average. 

This next figure highlights the relationship between how rich a district is and how fast its students learn on average. As above, the horizontal axis shows the average SES in the district [link to FAQ for explanation]. But here the vertical axis represents districts’ learning rates: the higher the district is located in the figure, the faster students’ test scores improve from one grade to the next. 

On average, learning rates are modestly higher in more affluent districts than in less affluent ones, but the data reveal many exceptions. Chicago boasts a learning rate 22 percent above average. But Anne Arundel County has learning rates 16 percent slower than average.

<br><br>Differences in learning rates add up. In Milwaukee, the scores of third-grade students in are similar to those in Chicago. But over time, their scores do not grow as much, so they are far behind the national average when they reach 8th grade.

Shown here is Grade 3 ...<br><br>

<br><br>and Grade 8.

Are the schools themselves the reason for this discrepancy in learning rates? It’s possible that other factors, such as family resources and the availability of afterschool programs within a given district, play some role. But even so, we have a better idea of how much students learn during their school years by looking at learning rates instead of average test scores. This brings us a step closer to understanding where public schools are most effective at providing learning opportunities and why the quality of public education can vary so dramatically from one school system to the next.

In Chicago at least, a community may provide its children with relatively low educational opportunities in one part of their lives (prior to 3rd grade), but may nonetheless provide extensive opportunities in another period (in late elementary and middle school). Is Chicago an anomaly? Do most communities generally provide high educational opportunities at all ages, or low opportunities at all ages? Are places where children learn a lot early in childhood also the places where they tend to learn the most during their later schooling years? Or are many places like Chicago—able to provide high opportunities in some periods of childhood but less so in others?

Again, the data provide us an answer.<br><br>

<br><br>The next figure compares districts’ learning rates with average test scores in 3rd grade. As above, districts higher in the figure have higher learning rates. In places on the left, students have had relatively few educational opportunities by the time they reach 3rd grade; on the right side, early educational opportunities are high. (See [link to discovery] to understand why average test scores measure opportunity in and out of school.)  

There is almost no relationship between the two measures. Districts with high scores in grade 3 don’t necessarily have high learning rates; nor do districts with low initial scores generally have low growth rates. <br><br>

<br><br>Districts in the upper right offer students substantial educational opportunities both before 3rd grade and through the middle school years.

Those in the lower left show the opposite: educational opportunities are scarce both in early childhood and through the elementary and middle school years.<br><br>

{{% state-wrapper state="state16" notmerge="true" %}}

<br><br>More generally, the data tell us not only where there is more or less educational opportunity, but when opportunity is available in each place. <br><br><br>

{{% state-wrapper state="state17" notmerge="true" %}}

<br><br>In the bottom right, for example, are districts like Anne Arundel where students have plentiful educational opportunities early in life, but show low growth after grade 3. These communities may need to focus their investments in expanding learning opportunities in the late elementary and middle school years.<br><br><br>


{{% /state-wrapper %}}

{{% state-wrapper state="state18" notmerge="true" %}}

<br><br>In the upper left are districts, like Chicago, where educational opportunities are concentrated during the schooling years. Here children have few opportunities early on, but show high growth after grade 3. Children in such place may benefit the most from investments focused on improving early childhood opportunities. 

If we want to improve children’s educational outcomes, we will need to change how—and where and when—we provide educational opportunities throughout children’s lives. Some people assume that we simply need to improve schools. Others argue that the schools are fine, but we need to provide more learning opportunities in early childhood—in children’s homes and childcare centers and preschool programs. The data show that there may be no one best strategy. Rather we need targeted strategies—targeted to specific age groups in specific places—to allow all of our children to reach their full potential, regardless of where they grow up.
