Can a school district overcome the effects that poverty has on its students? To answer that question, we need to rethink how we measure a school district’s quality.

Despite popular belief, average test scores are a bad indicator for measuring how much education students receive in a district. Average test scores by grade tell us more about the socioeconomic conditions of the students in a district than the district’s impact on student learning.

There’s a better way.

Measuring the growth of students’ test scores as they advance across the grades tells a more accurate story about a district’s impact on student learning. Some wealthy districts show a little learning across five years, some show a lot. Meanwhile, some poor districts show students who test way below average in grade 3 but catch up to the national average by grade 8.

The following charts tell an unexpected story of district quality and the amount of opportunity they afford students. These charts rely on standardized test scores for 45 million students across 11,000 school districts – nearly all in the U.S.

This figure shows the relationship between average 3rd grade achievement and average family socioeconomic status in any given school district. The trend is clear: The more affluence in a district, the higher the achievement among third graders.

This shouldn’t be surprising. Affluent families and districts are able to provide much greater opportunities than poor ones early in children’s lives. Viewed a different way, this figure captures the opportunities available to students before they turn 9 years of age. Family income, neighborhood conditions, the availability of high-quality child care and pre-school programs, and the quality of schools in grades K-3 are all captured in 3rd grade average scores.

Notice the yellow line moving from the lower left to the upper right of the figure. Broadly, it’s a prediction for how well a district’s 3rd graders will perform given the district’s socioeconomic status. Many districts follow that prediction line. But we also see the districts that have low test scores despite their affluence and high scores despite their poverty. Some districts do better than we would predict, and some districts do worse than we would predict. There’s a lot of variation.

The relationship between socioeconomic status and achievement appears to change in different ways for different districts as students age through the school system.

Unlike the clear trend connecting family wealth and average test scores, no such clear trend exists as students advance across the grades within the same district. In fact, a district’s wealth tells us little about the effectiveness of the district’s schools.

For example, 3rd graders in Chicago test below a 2nd-grade level...

...Grade 8.

By 8th grade they achieve near the national average, meaning that they experience the equivalent of six years of learning in the five years between 3rd and 8th grade. The results in Chicago show that a district’s low socioeconomic status isn’t predictive of student achievement over time, and that a poor district can give its students considerable opportunity—even a large one that enrolls hundreds of thousands of students.

Some poor districts show an opposite trend. Third-grade students in Milwaukee test similarly at 2nd-grade levels as do Chicago students, but do not grow as much, so they are far behind the national average when they reach 8th grade...

...Grade 8.

To be sure, growth rates don’t measure school impact alone. They may also depend on average family resources as well as other local conditions, including neighborhood characteristics and the availability of afterschool programs. But growth rates, unlike average test scores, tell us more about how much education students receive while in school.

What these figures show is that there is very little relationship between average 3rd grade test scores and average growth as students move from grades 3 through 8. Districts with high grade 3 scores don’t have the same outcomes: there are many with high growth and many with low growth as students progress through elementary and middle school. The same is true for districts with low initial scores.

How much we can glean from 8th grade average scores also varies considerably. Some districts have higher grade 3 scores and lower growth while others have lower initial grade 3 scores and higher growth. Snapshots in time aren’t as revealing as measuring growth over time.

The four quadrants compare each district’s early educational opportunities to its growth opportunities.

In the upper right are districts characterized by high early educational opportunity and high growth opportunity; these are districts where students have high average achievement in grade 3 and have above average growth rates following that.

This figure shows the relationship between average student growth and average family socioeconomic status in any given school district. Viewed a different way, it depicts the impact five years of school has on children between the ages of 9 and 14.

It’s not to be confused with the first figure, which showed the relationship between average test scores and family affluence. The first is a snapshot, while this is tracking progress of the same set of students over time.

Unlike the first figure in this exploration, this one indicates a weak relationship between a district’s socioeconomic status and the growth in test scores. In fact, while students in poor and affluent districts start at very different points, they grow at similar rates as they progress from 3rd through 8th grade.

One takeaway is that districts with far more low-income students can impart as much learning as districts with more affluent students. Because student growth indicates how much kids learn as they move from 3rd to 8th grade, it’s a better measure of school quality than average achievement is.
