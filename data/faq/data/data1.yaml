  The data are based on the standardized accountability tests in math and English Language Arts (ELA) administered annually by each state to all public-school students in grades 3–8 from 2008–09 through 2015–16. In these years, third- through eighth-graders in U.S. public schools took roughly 350 million standardized math and ELA tests. Their scores are the basis of the data reported here. 
  We combine information on the test scores in each school, school district, or county with information from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP; see https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/) to convert scores from state tests to a common national scale (see FAQ #3). 
  Individual student test scores are neither used nor reported here.
