abstract: |
  States and districts are increasingly incorporating measures of achievement growth into their
  school accountability systems, but there is little research on how these changes affect the public’s
  perceptions of school quality. We conduct a nationally representative online survey experiment to
  identify the effects of providing participants with information about their local school districts’
  average achievement status and/or average achievement growth. In the control group, participants
  who live in higher status districts tend to grade their local schools more favorably. The provision of
  status information does not fundamentally alter this relationship. The provision of growth
  information, however, reshapes Americans’ views about educational performance. Once informed,
  participants’ evaluations of their local public schools better reflect the variation in district growth.
