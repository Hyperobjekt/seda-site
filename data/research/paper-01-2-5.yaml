abstract: |
  The rapid expansion of school choice is restructuring public education in the United States. This study examines associations between charter and magnet
  school enrollment, White-Black and White-Hispanic segregation, and test
  score gaps at the district level from 2009 to 2015 in third to eighth grade using
  the Stanford Education Data Archive and the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s
  Common Core of Data. Robust findings indicate that higher charter school
  enrollment is associated with larger White-Black test score gaps and this effect
  is mediated by White-Black segregation. There is also evidence that magnet
  school enrollment is associated with White-Hispanic test score gaps. Overall,
  this study suggests that the expansion of school choice may have negative
  implications for structural education equity.
