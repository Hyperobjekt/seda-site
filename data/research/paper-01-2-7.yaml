abstract: |
  The school meals program is the largest nutritional assistance program for school-aged children. 
  Whereas program eligibility was historically determined by family income, recent reforms allow 
  schools to offer free meals to all students. This paper evaluates the effect of the Community 
  Eligibility Provision, the largest schoolwide free meals program, on academic performance. I l
  everage within- and across-state variation in the timing of CEP participation and find universal 
  free meals increases breakfast and lunch participation by 38 and 12 percent, respectively. 
  Math performance improves in districts with baseline low free meal eligibility, particularly 
  among racial/ethnic groups with low income-based participation rates.
