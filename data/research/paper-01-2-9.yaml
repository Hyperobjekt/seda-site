abstract: |
  There is growing interest in the relation between the racial achievement gap and the racial discipline gap. 
  However, few studies have examined this relation at the national level. This study combines data from the Stanford 
  Education Data Archive and the Civil Rights Data Collection and employs a district fixed effects analysis to examine 
  whether and the extent to which racial discipline gaps are related to racial achievement gaps in Grades 3 through 8 
  in districts across the United States. In bivariate models, we find evidence that districts with larger racial 
  discipline gaps have larger racial achievement gaps (and vice versa). Though other district-level differences 
  account for the positive association between the Hispanic-White discipline gap and the Hispanic-White achievement 
  gap, we find robust evidence that the positive association between the Black-White discipline gap and the Black-White 
  achievement gap persists after controlling for a multitude of confounding factors. We also find evidence that the 
  mechanisms connecting achievement to disciplinary outcomes are more salient for Black than White students.
