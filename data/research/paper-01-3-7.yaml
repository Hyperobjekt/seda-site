abstract: |
  We conduct an online survey experiment in which participants are asked to imagine that they are 
  parents moving to a new metropolitan area. They then choose between the five largest school 
  districts in that area. All participants receive demographic data for each district. In addition, 
  some participants are randomly assigned to receive average achievement and/or average growth 
  data for each district. While there are strong relationships between student demographics and 
  student achievement, the links between student demographics and student growth are much weaker. 
  We find that, on average, the provision of growth data causes participants to choose less 
  white and less affluent districts. Moreover, the provision of both achievement and growth data 
  causes participants to choose less white and less affluent districts than the provision of achievement data alone.
