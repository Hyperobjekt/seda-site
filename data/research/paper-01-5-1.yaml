abstract: "In this paper we compare two approaches to measuring the average rate at which students learn in a given school or district. One type of measure—longitudinal growth measures—relies on student-level longitudinal data. A second type—cohort growth measures—relies only on repeated aggregated, cross-sectional data. Because student-level data is often not readily available, cohort growth measures are sometimes the only type available. The estimated school and district learning rates reported in the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA), for example, are cohort growth measures based on aggregated data. Understanding how much researchers and policymakers can rely on these cohort growth estimates requires one to know how well, and under what conditions, the estimates obtained from this approach align with those based on longitudinal data. In this report we address these questions."
