abstract: "Although average student standardized test scores have improved steadily in recent decades, we do not know the extent to which these trends vary across school districts, nor whether gains have been equally shared by historically advantaged and disadvantaged student groups. To describe variation in district-level achievement trends in the post-recession period (2009 to 2018), we leverage longitudinal test scores from the Stanford Education Data Archive, which includes nearly 430 million test scores from every school district in the country. Though on average school districts improved by about 0.003 SDs per year, there is significant variation: the one-sixth of districts with the greatest gains have improved by more than three-quarters of a grade level, while the one-sixth of districts with the least improvement have declined by about two-thirds of a grade level or more. Additionally, we find that on average, the test score disparities between non-poor and poor students are growing, those between White and Black students are stagnating, and those between White and Hispanic students are shrinking. Trends in these gaps also vary widely among school districts. Moreover, we find no evidence of achievement-equity synergies or negative tradeoffs: improvements in overall achievement are uncorrelated with trends in achievement gaps. Finally, we describe the extent to which district characteristics can explain these trends. We find that the strongest predictors of achievement gap trends are the levels and trends in within-district racial and economic segregation and inequality."
