        <h4 tabindex="0">The educational opportunities available to children in a community are reflected in their average test scores.</h4>
        <p>Average test scores are influenced by children's opportunities to learn in their homes, in their neighborhoods, in the childcare, preschool, and after-school programs they attend, from their peers and friends, and in their schools. They reflect the total set of educational opportunities available in a community.</p>

        <h4 tabindex="0">Schools’ contributions to educational opportunity are reflected in the growth of children’s test scores while they are in school.</h4>
        <p>The growth of test scores indicates how much students learn while in school. Because average test scores are influenced by many out-of-school opportunities, they reflect more than what children learn while they are in school. 
            So growth of test scores is a better measure of school quality.

        <h4 tabindex="0">The change in test scores indicates whether educational opportunities are rising or falling in a community.</h4>
        <p>For example, rates of change tell us whether this year’s third graders are doing better than last year’s third graders. They reflect both changes in school quality and changes in other family and community features that provide opportunities for children.
