        <p>The Stanford Education Data Archive has built the first national database of comparable standardized test scores in the U.S., using more than 330 million test scores. The scores are based on tests administered in grades three through eight from 2009 to 2016 in each public school in the nation. </p>

        <p>from birth to the time they take the tests. Average scores are not good measures of school quality because they are shaped by much more than children’s schools—they also reflect all the children's opportunities to learn in their homes, in early childhood, in preschool, in their neighborhoods, and from their friends. Many of these out-of-school educational opportunities depend not on school quality, but on the socioeconomic resources that families have and can use to help their children learn.</p>

        <p>They measure the change in students’ knowledge and skills while they are in school, so they reflect the educational opportunities that children have during the years they are in elementary and middle school. They provide useful information about the contribution that <i>schools</i> make in students’ lives, and so are better measures of school quality than average test scores are.
