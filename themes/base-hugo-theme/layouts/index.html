        <p>from birth to the time they take the tests. The average scores are not good measures of school quality because they are shaped by much more than children’s schools. They reflect not just school-based learning opportunities, but also all the children's opportunities to learn in their homes, in early childhood, in preschool, in their neighborhoods, and from their friends. Many of these out-of-school educational opportunities depend not on school-quality, but on the socioeconomic resources that families have and can use to help their children learn.</p>
